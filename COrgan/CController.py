class CController:
    """
    This class performs the COrgan controller role. All service requests are
    passed to engine here both from Dashboard and RESTful API by LGateway, all
    service requests here are in a same view, means there no any concept of HTTP
    request, etc. This class is responsible for solving the request and give a
    response result to return immediately. It should be noticed that all return
    value of functions in LEngine are ALWAYS in this pattern:

        <NoExceptionRaisedFlag: bool, ExecutionResult: tuple>

    The first return value is a boolean, signals that whether any exception
    was occurred in executing. The second return value is a tuple, contains
    the specific result variable should be returned.
    Notice that there is a special case, when the SESSION of service request
    is invalid for the required service, the first return value will be set
    to FALSE, and the second return value is set to UNAUTHORIZED, a constant
    string, in GlobalConfigContext and logged to the runtime DB.
