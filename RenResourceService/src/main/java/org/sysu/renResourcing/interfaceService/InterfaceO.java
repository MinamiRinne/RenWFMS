 * Usage : Implementation of Interface O of Resource Service.
 *         Interface O is responsible for resources managements. In RenWFMS, we defined
 *         resources in COrgan, and register involved resources to Participant in Name
 *         Service. Hence we assert when Resource Service need to refer a RESOURCE, it
 *         has already been registered in steady memory as a PARTICIPANT. Therefore,
 *         this interface just for involved resources information retrieving.
